# Horiseon
Module 1 Challenge: This challenge was a practice in code refractoring. The original code from the markering agency did not follow the current set of standards for HTML. In addition, certain aspects of the code was not functioning properly so it needed to be fixed. The CSS was consolidated and reorganized to make it more efficient and easier to read and edit by other developers in the future.
